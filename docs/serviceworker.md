# Service Worker "Server"

The @:api(org.http4s.dom.ServiceWorker$) `FetchEvent` listener integrates directly with [http4s services](https://http4s.org/v0.23/docs/service.html). You can use it to run a "proxy server" as a background process in the browser that can intercept and respond to requests made by the `FetchClient`.

## Example
